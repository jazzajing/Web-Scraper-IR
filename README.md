# Web Scraping Project
***A GUI for searching through UEA People Directory***

## How To Use
- Download files to local machine
- Extract [data.zip](data.zip) files and move them to parent folder
- Run the main function in [main.py](main.py)
- Wait for the function to parse the txt files and voila the interface should pop up! üëç

## For Those Interested...
I have also included my Python files for:
- indexing the webpages
- a simple retriever for AND, NOT & OR queries
- parsing the pages using Beautiful Soup 4
- creating snippets for the GUI
- calculating tf-idf scores for terms
